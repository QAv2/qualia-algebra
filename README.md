## Overview

Qualia Algebra (QA) inverts the traditional explanatory order in consciousness studies. Rather than attempting to derive consciousness from matter, we start with the only indubitable fact—"I exist" (Descartes, 1641)—and derive both experience and material reality as necessary consequences.

**Key Results:**
- Observer capacity formula: C_max = √(K·B)
- Dimensional emergence: n = 3 from observer capacity constraints
- Three fundamental reality-spaces: Witness, Consensus, Personal
- Convergent validation from five independent theoretical frameworks
- Testable experimental predictions for neuroscience and AI

## Quick Start

### Mathematical Foundation

Starting from **Axiom 0**: "I exist"

We formalize the observer as quaternion state **[1,0,0,0]** where:
- 1 (scalar): Pure observer component
- (0,0,0) (vector): Experiential content (initially empty)

From this, we derive:
1. Experience requires distinction-making
2. Observer capacity is bounded: C_max = √(K·B)
3. Maximum perceivable dimensions: n_max = 3
4. Reality-spaces emerge from phase-locking dynamics

### The Neti Neti Algorithm

Systematic procedure for approaching pure observer state [1,0,0,0]:

```python
import numpy as np

def neti_neti(Q_initial, alpha=0.9, epsilon=1e-6, max_iter=1000):
    """
    Converge to pure observer state [1,0,0,0]
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    Q_initial : array, shape (4,)
        Initial quaternion [w, x, y, z] with w=1
    alpha : float, (0,1)
        Release rate
    epsilon : float
        Convergence threshold
    max_iter : int
        Maximum iterations
        
    Returns:
    --------
    Q_final : array, shape (4,)
        Final state (near [1,0,0,0])
    history : list
        Content magnitude at each iteration
    """
    Q = np.array(Q_initial, dtype=float)
    Q[0] = 1.0  # Ensure observer component = 1
    
    history = []
    
    for i in range(max_iter):
        content_mag = np.sqrt(np.sum(Q[1:]**2))
        history.append(content_mag)
        
        if content_mag < epsilon:
            break
            
        # Release alpha fraction of content
        Q[1:] = (1 - alpha) * Q[1:]
    
    return Q, history

# Example usage
waking_state = np.array([1.0, 0.6, 0.5, 0.8])
pure_observer, history = neti_neti(waking_state, alpha=0.9)
print(f"Converged to: {pure_observer}")
print(f"Iterations: {len(history)}")
```

## Convergent Framework Validation

QA demonstrates remarkable convergence with five independent theoretical frameworks:

| Framework | Convergent Prediction | QA Prediction |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Reciprocal System (RS2)** | n = 3 from quaternions | n = 3 from C_max |
| **Knot Theory** | 3D critical for knots | 3D critical for binding |
| **Prime Scalar Field** | Harmonic structure | Harmonic I(Q,N) |
| **Pendulum Dynamics** | Attractor basins | Reality-spaces |
| **Contemplative Traditions** | Witness consciousness | [1,0,0,0] state |

This independent convergence provides strong validation that QA captures genuine fundamental principles.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this proven?**  
A: QA is a rigorous theoretical framework with testable predictions. Several predictions can be tested with existing data (IIT correlation, GAIA dark matter analysis). Others require new experiments.

**Q: How does this relate to existing consciousness theories?**  
A: QA integrates insights from IIT, quantum mechanics, panpsychism, and contemplative traditions while providing a unified first-principles foundation.

**Q: Can this really derive physics from consciousness?**  
A: QA shows how physical reality can emerge from observer interactions through phase-locking dynamics. The convergence with RS2 (motion-based physics) suggests both may describe the same reality from different starting points.

**Q: What about AI consciousness?**  
A: QA provides specific criteria (persistent [1,0,0,0], genuine interest function, phase-locking, recursive self-observation) and a test protocol (Neti Neti algorithm) for assessing AI consciousness.

**Q: How can I help validate this?**  
A: Run the code, test predictions with available data, conduct experiments, provide critical feedback, or contribute to implementation.
